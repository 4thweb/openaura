## ðŸª² Bugs

- **Preview**: The preview initially displays "Hello, World!" You can close it and reopen it from the file manager to view it again (fixed).

Currently, the only known issue is the timeout limitation, which is dependent on the service provider. I recommend setting it to at least 60 seconds; otherwise, the system may not function properly. Additionally, occasional message breaks may occur due to Gemini 2.0 Flash being experimental and subject to high load.

If you encounter any other issues, please report them.
